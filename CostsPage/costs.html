            <h2>Costs of Green Energy</h2>
            <p>
              Green power includes various types like wind and solar energy,
              each with its own pros and cons, particularly regarding cost.
              Different types of renewable energy have varying costs, tax
              rebates, tax credits, and regulations. Tax rebates involve getting
              money back, while tax credits can lower the amount of taxes people
              pay.

              <h3>Hydro</h3>
              <p>
                Hydroelectic power typically costs 0.85 cents per killowatt an
                hour. The amount of kilowatts needed to power a home is 10
                killowatts meaning that the average home only needs to pay $8.50
                an hour. The amount of tax rebates you can get for hydroelectic
                power is

              <h3>Wind</h3>
              <p>
                Wind power costs below 2 cents per killowatt an hour and a house
                using wind power is in the range from 5-15 killowatts an hour.
                The amount of tax credits you can get for setting up a wind
                turbine would be 30% because of the Production Tax Credit.

                average home needs around 5-8.5 killowatts to power an average

            <h2>What Should You Pick?</h2>
            <p>
              If you have a house and if the local regulations in your area
              allow for you to have renewable energy, then you should definitely
              get some type of green energy, but what is the best type for you
              to have? There is only one where you could actually install and
              that would be solar because the city usually builds hydroelectic
              and wind power so solar is the only option for private citizens to
              buy, but the best one to live in would probably be hydroelectic
              power because it is the most consistent and gives you a lot of tax
              credits to reduce taxes.
