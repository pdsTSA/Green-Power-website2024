        <h2>Green Power Partnership</h2>
        <p>The EPA's Green Power Partnership promotes voluntary involvement in the green power market by providing information, assistance, and acknowledgment to companies employing green power. These companies commit to using green power for a portion or all of their yearly electricity consumption. Presently, partners' green power usage represents close to 37% of the U.S. voluntary green power market (excluding hydropower). Since its establishment in 2001, the program has aided in preventing almost 280 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
